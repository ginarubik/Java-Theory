In Java “an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions” is called an exception. 
This is generally an unexpected or unwanted event which can occur either at compile-time or run-time in application code. 
Java exceptions can be of several types and all exception types are organized in a fundamental hierarchy.
